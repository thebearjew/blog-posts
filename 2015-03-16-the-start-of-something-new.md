Today marks my first blog post. A little narcissistic I know... However, my own blog has been something I've wanted for quite some time.

The first version of a "blog", if you want to call it that, was actually my journal, which I started writing in high school. I had fallen victim to senioritis at the shockingly incorrect time of junior year. I had basically checked out of school by the time my last year of classes were rolling around, so I took leisure in picking those classes.

Hoping for a blow off class I chose "Journaling" as my first semester senior blow off class. I was told the class consisted of writing in a personal journal (diary if you prefer that) for 48 minutes once, everyday, for roughly four months. That was it; simple right?

Over the class' four months, I was challenged in more ways than I ever had been. Ignoring the challenge of volume (three handwritten pages per day, fifteen per week), I had to dig deep into myself just to find things to fill those pages. After two weeks of class, I had run out of every casual topic which interested me (I'm lying, it was only [Dota 2](http://blog.dota2.com)), so I wrote about my feeling, my nightly dreams, my goals, and my fears.

The class started to work on me. Through only the requirement of fifteen pages of writing per week, a cynical, probably arrogant, 17 year old kid learned how to speak about his feelings. No sensitive talking circles required, just a lot of individual writing every single day.

The habitual nature of putting every internal and external event on paper stuck with me after that class. When I backpacked Europe for a month after high school the process of *downloading* that day's events and thoughts stuck. It turned into such an effective method for reflecting and recharging that I consciously made efforts to continue. 

Today I use [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com) to hold all of my journalling, no more pen and paper required. Day One is for iOS and  OS X and does an outstanding job of displaying and encouraging great journalling. They made fun meta data to add to your entries to help reflect: *weather*, *steps*, *music*, *location*, *time*, and more. All these fun data points can remind you or add to an entry in ways your words may not be able to. It's a pretty great solution to a pretty niche problem: making the best journals for yourself, anywhere.

### Tying It All Together

This blog is not going to be a stream of personal journaling. Unless expressed otherwise, I'm safe to assume no one wants to hear about my feelings today, what I ate, or who I talked to. Instead the blog will build on tools and techniques from personal journalling to be better than a stream of consciousness.

A blog should be refined. Not like *The New York Times*, but polished. The kind an car enthusiast puts on their new BMW or 56' Cadillac. Effort and care is given, but it's far from the trade show shine.

However, cars will likely never be a topic here (not going to pull a reverse [ATP](http://neutral.fm)). Expect new programming topics, new paradigms, surviving college, living in San Francisco, and figuring it all out. I might throw in the occasional social-bullshit rant, or tv show analysis (*wink wink*) and the idea is, if I write it well, it will interest you as well.

That's what I want you, and me, to get out of this blog: an appreciation for thoughtfulness and effort, spiced with the fun of programming, tech, and all the rest.

I hope you take this journey with me.
