Not very long ago I discovered a simple and amazing shortcut for iOS from reddit. A text shortcut where "@@" would replace my primary email address anywhere I entered it in my phone. I added this text shortcut by going to *Settings* > *General* > *Keyboard* > *Shortcuts* then entering my email as the "phrase" and *@@* as the "shortcut".
<!-- more -->

Entering my email into every website and app in iOS is a massive pain and significantly difficult on a mobile keyboard. Over the last year, this small hack has saved me **hours** when logging in and out of multiple Google, Facebook, and Twitter accounts, as well as linking to others.

So I took it a step further and attempted to create "quick pastes" for all of my commonly entered fields. As a result I've come up with a fun little paradigm for turning any personal link (email, Twitter, Google, Github, reddit) into a memorable text shortcut. It works as follows:

- Attempt to abbreviate the "username" into one or two characters
- The @ symbol
- Then attempt to abbreviate the website, apps, domain, email service, etc. into one or two characters
- Concatenate the above in order and you have a shortcut!

Here are the ones I have made so far:

#### Email
- @@ *or* j@g = my Gmail address
- j@jy = [jacob@jacobyoung.me](mailto:jacob@jacobyoung.me)
- j@y = my YahooMail address

#### Social
- jry@twt = [@JakeRYoung](https://twitter.com/JakeRYoung)
- jyb@twt = [@JYBlog](https://twitter.com/JYBlog)
- dvc@twt = [@dvcoers](https://twitter.com/dvcoders)
- jy@fb = Facebook profile
- dvc@fb = dvcoders Facebook
- jy@li = [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/jacobryoung)

#### Finance
- cb@bit = [Coinbase Page](https://www.coinbase.com/jacobyoung)
- b@bit = Personal wallet
- \$@\$ = [Square Cash](https://cash.square.com/$jacobyoung)

Using this method rapidly becomes second nature. Start with your email, you'll be shocked how nice it is to tap two buttons and have a long annoying email already pasted for you.

A quick note on the prefixes for each account. I chose to use "jy@whatever" a lot because it prevented any namespace conflicts with Twitter or email which use the @ naming convention. If however, you have an account which doesn't require the username prefix, by all means make it you own. Ultimately this is a simple and easy to understand method for turning dozens of emails and accounts into easily manageable text shortcuts.

Hopefully this will change how you use your iOS device like it did for me. If you come up with some awesome shortcuts I would *love* to hear about them [@JakeRYoung](https://twitter.com/JakeRYoung)
